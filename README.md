## Project Structure

Click-Counter/
├── index.html
├── click-counter.css
├── click-counter.js
└── README.md
```

* `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the page structure.
* `click-counter.css`: The CSS stylesheet for styling the page.
* `click-counter.js`: The JavaScript file for the counter logic.
* `README.md`: This file.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser:** Simply double-click the file or open it with your preferred browser.

## Functionality Details

* The page displays a heading, a counter display (initially showing 0), and a "Click Me!" button.
* Clicking the "Click Me!" button increments the counter by 1.
* The counter display updates to show the new count.
* When the button is clicked the number display will briefly scale up, and then return to its normal size.

## JavaScript Logic

* The JavaScript code retrieves references to the counter display and the increment button.
* An event listener is attached to the button to handle click events.
* When the button is clicked, the counter variable is incremented, and the counter display is updated.
* The counter display element is briefly scaled up using CSS transforms, and then returned to its original size using a `setTimeout` function.

## CSS Styling

* The CSS styles the counter container, counter display, and increment button.
* The counter display is styled with a background color, padding, and rounded corners.
* The increment button is styled with a background color, text color, and hover effect.

## Potential Enhancements

* Add a "Reset" button to reset the counter.
* Add a "Decrement" button to decrease the counter.
* Implement persistent storage (e.g., local storage) to save the counter value between page reloads.
* Add more visual customization.
* Add keyboard accessibility.
